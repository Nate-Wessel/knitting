# Hats!

I've made a few in worsted alpaca that worked out pretty well so far. Came close to one skein each, ~220 yards... when I didn't make them too short. 1/1 rib stitch all the way with a fairly improvised purl-2 reduction at the crown. The reductions were worked with markers spaced 20 stitches apart and the reduction happening in the same place in each group. Started with one reduction per group, finished it off in the next pass, then one more row of 1/1 with no reductions. Toward the very top I was reducing faster. Not sure yet if that was / is the right way or if it would be better to keep it steady.

The light grey one had 160 stitches cast one. The shorter black one did too, but I used the same black yarn again for a 140 stitch version that fits a lot tighter. We'll have to see how that one wears. I think it will stretch to the right size. 

# Top down variant
Cast on 10st and join in the round. Worsted yarn, 3mm needles. KFB increases on every stitch on the first round, then a round of k1/p1 rib, no increases. Separate into 5 secions with markers (4st each at this point) with a different color for the start. Begin increasing regularly for a few rounds with sets of two adjacent KFB increases starting after a purl stitch. One pair of increases in each section, and in the next round, just rib. This will produce a flat disk. Offset subsequent paired increases so they're not on top of eachother. 

Once a section reaches 20st (100st total round), start making more passes after each increase round to turn the corner. Once the desired circumference #st is reached, you're in the home stretch; just keep working rib until it's done and cast off with a tubular bind off for stretch. 

You should be able to try the hat on as you go if your needles are long enough, to check the length.
