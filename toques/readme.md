# Hats!

I've made a few in worsted alpaca that worked out pretty well so far. Came close to one skein each, ~220 yards... when I didn't make them too short. 1/1 rib stitch all the way with a fairly improvised purl-2 reduction at the crown. The reductions were worked with markers spaced 20 stitches apart and the reduction happening in the same place in each group. Started with one reduction per group, finished it off in the next pass, then one more row of 1/1 with no reductions. Toward the very top I was reducing faster. Not sure yet if that was / is the right way or if it would be better to keep it steady.

The light grey one had 160 stitches cast one. The shorter black one did too, but I used the same black yarn again for a 140 stitch version that fits a lot tighter. We'll have to see how that one wears. I think it will stretch to the right size.
