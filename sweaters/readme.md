# Sweaters

## the plan so far

top down raglan in worsted wool (purple!). I have six hanks and pray it's enough. 


## swatches
swatched stockinette at 29 st = 5 3/4 in = 5.04st/in

swatched k1p1 rib 30st at 5" (stretched)
...assuming the neckband will relax under some tension

## the action so far

* For a 20" neckline, I cast on 120st joined in the round.
* Worked five rows in k1p1 rib, then put in a lifeline
* With the first stitch at center back, I marked the CF (opposite) and shoulder lines at 24st from CB.

* Raglan lines then are marked around the top sleeve at 18st and 34st from CB.
* start german short rows with the first set going to 10st from the CB, increasing 10st each row until reaching near the front
* after short rows, begin increases around the sleeve markers
    * raglan increases will be worked as a pair with two knits between M1R,K,K,M1L 
        * the marker between the K,K
    * after a row with increases, a row of only knits
* put in a lifeline after doing this for 22 rows
* stopped increasing the front and back panels at this point while still increasing the sleeves at the same rate
	* did this for 19 more rows, then decided I hadn't done enough short-row shaping and tossed in another pair of short-rows around the back and sleeves
	* another ten rows of the same increase pattern, then decided the body wasn't going to be broad enough after counting stitches and doing math. 

I am now aiming for the front and back panels to be equally wide at 98st = ~19.5". The sleeves aiming for 80st each for ~15.8" circumference

* At this point I did a haphazard series of increases and skipped increases to meet these goals that I probably should have set myself earlier. Once I get there I will try it on again and hopefully be ready to start separating the sleeves and body
