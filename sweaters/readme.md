# Sweaters

## Overview
This is meant to be my block pattern - a basic crewneck top-down raglan in worsted yarn. It should fit me well and form the basis for other designs later on.

## Swatching
* sweater one
	- swatched stockinette at 29 st = 5 3/4 in = 5.04st/in
	- swatched k1p1 rib 30st at 5" (stretched) ...assuming the neckband will relax under some tension
* sweater two
	- roughly the same but I chose to not measure and just wing it :0

## Neckband
* Having learned from the neck of the first sweater, I cast on (long tail) 100st joined in the round, vs 120 for the first; using the 3mm needles. I think this yarn will be a little bulkier, and I also want the neck to end up a lot narrower. To this end, the for the second sweater was worked to about 18-20 rows, folded that double, and knit it into a folded neckband more or less following the instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYyvunQzRNg).

From here on out you'll be working on the larger 4mm needles, so the next stitches will be transitioning onto those. 

### Mark the raglan increase lines
With the magic loop ends at CF and CB, I marked the four increase points at
* back: 15st from CB
* front: 30st from CB (15st forward from the back markers)

This leaves a longer front collar, for it to dip down as the neck shaping is done in the next steps. 

## Neck shaping + raglan increases
* start german short rows with the first set going to 10st from the CB, increasing 10st each row until reaching near the front
* after short rows, begin increases around the sleeve markers
    * raglan increases will be worked as a pair with two knits between M1R,K,K,M1L 
        * the marker between the K,K
    * after a row with increases, a row of only knits
* put in a lifeline after doing this for 22 rows
* stopped increasing the front and back panels at this point while still increasing the sleeves at the same rate
	* did this for 19 more rows, then decided I hadn't done enough short-row shaping and tossed in another pair of short-rows around the back and sleeves
	* another ten rows of the same increase pattern, then decided the body wasn't going to be broad enough after counting stitches and doing math. 

I am now aiming for the front and back panels to be equally wide at 98st = ~19.5". The sleeves aiming for 80st each for ~15.8" circumference

* At this point I did a haphazard series of increases and skipped increases to meet these goals that I probably should have set myself earlier. Once I get there I will try it on again and hopefully be ready to start separating the sleeves and body. 


## Splitting the sleeves from the body

Once the right length is reached, put the sleeve stitches on some waste yarn and set them aside for later. The division between sleeve and body is between the two knit stitches running along between the paired increases.

## Body

Once you've reached the underarm, [separate the sleeves from the body and cast on 10st at the underarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmaIYuHHlt8) on each side of the body. At theis point, the body will have XXXst in the round; just keep working it straight down until it's at the desired length... and of course add 1x1 ribbing at the bottom, casting off [tubularly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jPMLIE7ac8).

## Sleeves

Pick up the sleeves following the instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euTp37dlhlM). Add stitch markers between the regular and picked-up stitches. Work a few rows plain, then start paired decreases to cut down the added underarm stitches quickly. Paired decrease, then two rounds plain, and keep reducing like this until the added stitches are gone and the two markers are one. Now keep working the decreases one at a time on either side of the one marker, decrease, then two rows, decrease, then two rows, alternating sides. 

I ended the decreases with 10g of yarn left on the ball used for the sleeve, and 46s around the wrist. I then started a 1/1 rib tightly on smaller needles and continued that for about 3" before casting off with a [tubular bind off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jPMLIE7ac8).
