# Sweaters

## the plan so far

top down raglan in worsted wool (purple!). I have six hanks and pray it's enough. 


## swatches
swatched stockinette at 29 st = 5 3/4 in = 5.04st/in

swatched k1p1 rib 30st at 5" (stretched)
...assuming the neckband will relax under some tension

## the action so far

* For a 20" neckline, I cast on 120st joined in the round. 
* Worked five rows in k1p1 rib, then put in a lifeline
* With the cast on start at center back, I marked the CF (opposite) and shoulder lines at 24st from CB.
