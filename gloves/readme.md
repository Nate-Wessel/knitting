# Gloves

Knitted from wrist toward fingers in worsted weight wool on 3mm needles.

Cast on 60 in the round and work a 1-1 rib for the wristband. Transition to stockinette and begin slow increases on the thumb side, doing one increase for every 2-3 rows. Try the glove on as you go, making sure you know where the wristband should sit. 

Once the bottom of the thumb is reached, divide off the portion of the round that should go toward/around that finger and place the _rest_ of the round on a spare yarn. Start knitting the thumb by [casting on 3-5 new stitches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmaIYuHHlt8) and then working in the round. Again, keep trying it on to assess length. Once nearing the tip, reduce to ~8-10 stitches and cinch them together with the yarn end.

Next, pick up the rest of the stitches from the waste yarn (get those cast on stitches similar to a [sweater underarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euTp37dlhlM)) and work the main body for another couple of cm until the base of the pinky is reached.

Repeat the finger process for the pinky and then knit the main body up a few rows. The middle three fingers can all be added at the same level.
